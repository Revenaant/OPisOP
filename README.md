# OPisOP
Educational Unity game for touchscreen


OPisOP is an educational game made for the Oyfo Museum in Hengelo. The purpose of the game is to teach children energy management by having them take care of their own pet. The player needs to make sure the pet in the dome gets enough food, warmth so it stays happy.

This project was developed for a touchscreen PC. I worked on the camera controls and built the core system for transferring energy between machines. Aside from this, I worked on many more aspects of the game, like gameplay, UI, shaders, sounds and overall polish and feel of the game.
